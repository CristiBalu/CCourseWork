Both C and Unix strike a very good
balance among expressiveness, efficiency and
economy of means. That means that they
are a good base to build on: the good ideas
are worth stealing and the efficiency sets a
standard of comparison. It's also easier for
people to make a transition from
something familiar than to make a big change,
so a language or system that has significant
elements of familiarity is more
likely to be a success.
